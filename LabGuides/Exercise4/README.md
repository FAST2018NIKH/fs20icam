# Exercise 4 Installing and configuring a Synthetics PoP

[Go back to the Table of Contents](../../README.md)

In this exercise, you will be installing a synthetic PoP (point of presence).  The PoP server can be used to playback synthetic tests to proactively monitor your websites and REST APIs.

Knowledge center reference: https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SS8G7U_19.4.0/com.ibm.app.mgmt.doc/content/dc_synthetics_intro.html?cp=SSFC4F_1.2.0

## Installing the Sythetics Point-of-Presence agent

Once again you will be using the configpack that you previously downloaded from the ICAM server.  The configpack tells the synthetic PoP and data collectors where to send the performance KPIs.

### 1. In the terminal window, where you are connected to the managed cluster, run the following commands:

```
cd /home/localuser/install/app_mgmt_syntheticpop_xlinux
./precheck.sh
./config-pop.sh -f ../app_mgmt_k8sdc/ibm-cloud-apm-dc-configpack.tar
```

Answer the installation wizard with the following values:
<pre>
You will configure a new local point of presence (PoP).

Enter a name for your PoP. Your PoP will be identified by this name: <span style="color:orange"><b>pop_user1</b> <-- Use your user id</span><br>
The PoP name is set to pop_user1


Enter the name of the country in which your PoP is located: <span style="color:orange"><b>Austria</b> <-- Use any country</span><br>
The country name is set to Austria


Enter the name of the city in which your PoP is located: <span style="color:orange"><b>Vienna</b> <-- Use any city</span><br>
The city name is set to Vienna


Enter a description of your PoP (optional): <span style="color:orange"><b>FS20pop</b> <-- It is just descritpion</span><br>
The description is set to "FS20pop"


Enter the proxy server address for communicating with IBM ICAM server. The address format is ip:port (Press Enter if you do not need to use a proxy) :  <span style="color:orange">Press Enter</span><br>
Proxy server address for communicating with IBM ICAM server is set to 


Update the proxy type (no | manual | pac) for playbacking synthetic tests to monitor your web applications. Enter 'no' to choose no proxy. Enter 'manual' to configure your proxy with a proxy server ip address and port number. Enter 'pac' to use an automatic configuration URL. (Press Enter if you do not want to make any changes: no): <span style="color:orange">Press Enter</span><br>
Playback proxy type is set to no


Your PoP is configured with the following details:
LOCATION="pop_user1,Austria,Vienna,0,0,FS20pop"
AGENT_PROXY_SERVER=""
PLAYBACK_PROXY_TYPE="no"
PLAYBACK_PROXY_HOST_PORT=""
PLAYBACK_PROXY_BYPASS=""
PLAYBACK_PROXY_CONFIG_URL=""
CACHE_REDIS_MAX_SIZE_MB=""

Do you confirm? [y for yes or n for no]: <span style="color:orange">Press <b>'y'</b></span><br>
pop.properties is configured! You can run start-pop.sh to start your PoP.
</pre>

### 2. Start the Synthetics PoP agent
   
```
./start-pop.sh
```

Synthetic PoP will start up and run as a docker container.

## Configuring the syntetic playback test

### 3. Open the Syntetics administration view

In the IBM Cloud App Management User Interface go to the **Administration** tab and select the **Synthetics** tile

### 4. Creating new test

Click **Create** button

![](images/2020-01-15-13-33-53.png)

Give your test a name and description.

Scroll down and select the test type (Webpage)

![](images/2020-01-15-13-36-26.png)

In the next step you need to provide the URL of the bookinfo main application page.

As the managed cluster you use in the lab is really lightweight, it does not have the ingress installed. For testing you will use Cluster IP. To find out the ClusterIP run the following command:

```
kubectl get svc -n bookinfo |grep productpage |awk '{print "http://" $3 ":9080/productpage?u=normal"}'
```
   
Scroll down and provide the following values:

    URL: http://10.10.187.169:9080/productpage?u=normal   <--- Make sure you use the URL from above step

    Threshold value for Warning: 1

    Threshold value for Critical: 2

Click **Verify test**

<span style="color:red">**ATTENTION:**</span> The test will timeout as your browser don't have access to that page, but the Synthetic PoP does have access. Ignore the pop-up dialog and click **Next**

![](images/2020-01-15-13-51-17.png)

On the next page, change the test frequency to 1 minute and make sure that your previously installed PoP agent is selected

![](images/2020-01-15-17-11-44.png)

Click **Finish** at the bottom of the page

### 4. Viewing the Sythetic playback results

Go back to the **Administration** page and then click **Synthetic results** tab and the test name

![](images/2020-01-15-17-18-53.png)

Verify that the Bookinfo application is running

Note: It may take a few minutes before the synthetic playback tests are visible in the user interface.

This concludes the exercise.
