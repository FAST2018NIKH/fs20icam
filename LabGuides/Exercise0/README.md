# Accessing the lab environment

[Go back to the Table of Contents](../../README.md)

For the FastStart 2020 labs related to the IBM Cloud Pak for Multicloud Management - IBM Cloud App Management component you will be using the central Hub server installed in IBM Cloud. This environment is setup to be multi-tenant where each student has their own isolated tenant.  Each student will have their own ICP cluster in Skytap that you will manage from the centralized Hub server.

You connect to the hub using a web browser and userX assigned to you by lab instructor (each participant has unique id)

In parallel you connect to a managed cluster via SSH with credentials: localuser/passw0rd (all partitipants use the same credentials)

## Connecting to the IBM CloudPak for Multicloud Management Hub

To access the Hub cluster open a browser on your workstation and point it to:

**Group A**

<a href="https://icp-console.apps.169.61.23.248.nip.io" target="_blank">https://icp-console.apps.169.61.23.248.nip.io</a>

**Group B**

<a href="https://icp-console.icamfs2020-6550a99fb8cff23207ccecc2183787a9-0001.us-south.containers.appdomain.cloud" target="_blank">https://icp-console.icamfs2020-6550a99fb8cff23207ccecc2183787a9-0001.us-south.containers.appdomain.cloud</a>


**ATTENTION: Lab tutorials were tested with Firefox browser.**

## Connecting to the managed cluster

Go to [https://ibm.biz/fs20skytap](https://ibm.biz/fs20skytap) and register with the email and access code for the session.

To access the managed cluster you need a terminal with SSH client. On Mac or Linux workstation use a regular terminal, on Windows use Putty

<span style="color:red">**IT IS NOT RECOMMENDED TO USE SKYTAP UI TO CONNECT TO THE MACHINE - YOU WILL USE A TERMINAL CONNECTION DIRECTLY FROM YOUR WORKSTATION**</span>

You should see the page that looks like this

Take a note of address and the port number, next to the **managed-cluster** VM. In above example, it is *services-uscentral.skytap.com* and *12316*. It is the SSH port exposed from the virtal machine for your instance (for managed cluster)

Open the terminal on your workstation. Connect to the VM using user **localuser** with password **passw0rd**

For Mac and Linux
```
ssh -p <port> localuser@<address>
```

for example:
```
ssh -p 12316 localuser@services-uscentral.skytap.com
```

For Windows use putty

## Copying files between your local workstation and managed-cluster

When you need to copy any file between your local workstation and managed-cluster in Skytap, use the following:

For Mac and  Linux
```
scp -P <port> <source-file> localuser@services-uscentral.skytap.com:<target-path>
```

For Windows use WinSCP or equivalent tool
