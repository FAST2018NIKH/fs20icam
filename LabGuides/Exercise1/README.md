# Exercise 1 Adding a managed cluster

[Go back to the Table of Content](../../README.md)

During this lab, MCM klusterlet is deployed to a managed cluster on a multi-tenant environment.

## Login to IBM CloudPak for Multicloud Management console

### 1. On you workstation open a browser and point it to https://icp-console.apps.169.61.23.248.nip.io

### 2. Login with the credentials given you by the instructors

### 3. Open **Menu**, then **Automate infrastructure** then **Clusters**

### 4. Click **Add cluster**

### 5. Pick the **Import** option and click **Select**

### 6. Specify your userid when prompted for the cluster name (namspace will auto-populate with the same value).  By naming the cluster with your userid, we'll ensure that there are no duplicate cluster names. 

Edit the **Cluster import YAML file** to: 
 - uncomment ```environment``` and ```region``` clusterLabels 
 - disable prometheusIntegration

   Then click **Generate command**

If you see the following error

it means that your cluster name does not match your userid

*Explanation: For each tenant we have precreated the namespaces matching the userid and assigned them to relevant teams/tenants as managed resource. Since working as userX you don't have cluster admin role you do not have access rights to create a new namespace*


### 7. Click the copy icon next to the generated command

### 8. Paste the command in the terminal window where you connected to the managed-cluster environment

You don't need to authenticate to the managed cluster. It is a minimal (edge-profile) ICP installation without IAM services deployed so cloudctl command won't work against that cluster.

If you see the following error
```
error: unable to recognize "STDIN": no matches for kind "Endpoint" in version "multicloud.ibm.com/v1beta1"
```
just apply the command again.

*EXPLANATION: First resource being created registers new API Endpoint "multicloud.ibm.com/v1beta1". Last resource uses this API. In case the last resource is processes before the first one is completed (Kubernetes Controllers work asynchronously) this may happen.* 

### 9. Observe the multicluster-endpoint being deployed running the following command
```
kubectl get pods -n multicluster-endpoint
```
After about 2 minutes the output should look like:
```
localuser@edge-server:~$ kubectl get pods -n multicluster-endpoint

```

### 10.  Go back to the browser window. Click **View Cluster** to open a cluster details.

### 11.  If registration was successful you should see the similar view

This concludes the exercise. You now have a kubernetes cluster that can be managed by MCM and monitored by ICAM.
